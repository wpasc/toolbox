# Shared

Cross-project resources that don't belong to a single project.

## Structure

```
scripts/      # Utilities useful across multiple projects
references/   # Cheatsheets, links, external resources
notes/        # General learning notes (not project-specific)
```

## What Goes Here

- Scripts that work across projects (e.g., general shell utilities)
- Reference materials that span topics (e.g., git cheatsheet, bash tips)
- Learning notes that aren't tied to a specific project
