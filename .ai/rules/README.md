# Project-Specific AI Rules

This directory contains conditional AI guidance specific to this project.

## Rule Files

| File | Load When |

## Authority

- CLAUDE.md takes precedence over files in this directory
- External standards in cross_project_ai_resources take precedence over both
- These rules supplement, not override, the standard guidelines

## Adding New Rules

Add a rule file when:
- Domain-specific guidance is needed repeatedly
- The guidance is too verbose for CLAUDE.md
- Multiple related rules form a cohesive topic

Keep CLAUDE.md as the primary reference; use this directory sparingly.
