# Quick Capture Vision

**Date:** 2026-02-19

## The Aha Moment

The glue I want isn't just a NeoVim thing — it's a **quick capture workflow** that lives wherever I am.

## How It Works

1. **Hotkey** opens a small modal / minimal input form
2. **Type a note** — free-form, whatever's on my mind ("Oh, here's a note about another thing")
3. **Quick keybind to send** — fires it off and I'm back to what I was doing
4. A system called **Will** receives the note and routes it to my inbox/triage

## The Key Insight: AI-Augmented Triage

The inbox/triage system is AI-augmented. The friction it removes:

- I don't have to think about *where* a note belongs
- Will helps me decide the right place for it
- Capture and organization become two separate concerns — I only handle capture in the moment

## Open Questions

- What does the modal/input look like? (NeoVim floating window? tmux popup? Something else?)
- What does Will's routing/triage actually look like?
- Where does the inbox live?
- What are the destinations Will can route to?
