# Projects

Self-contained tools and workflows. Each project lives in its own directory with everything it needs.

## Structure

Each project follows this layout:

```
[project]/
  config/     # Dotfiles and configuration
  notes/      # Learning notes specific to this project
  scripts/    # Project-specific utilities
  README.md   # Overview, status, setup instructions
```

## Current Projects

- **neovim/** - NeoVim setup, configuration, and learning
- **tmux/** - tmux configuration and workflow

## Adding a New Project

1. Create a new directory: `projects/[name]/`
2. Add subdirectories as needed: `config/`, `notes/`, `scripts/`
3. Create a `README.md` explaining what the project is and how to use it
